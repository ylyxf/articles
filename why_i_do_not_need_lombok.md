the lombok.jar has some magic annotations like @Setter @Geter on class's property, 
it will generate set/get methods when the .java compiled to .class.
we can wirte less code , but when i want to know who and when set this property in debug mode in eclipse , i can't set any break point.
i think the debug ability is more improt then clear code.
